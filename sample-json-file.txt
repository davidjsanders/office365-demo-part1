# This file should NEVER be in a code repository. It contains your
# application's unique identified (a 4 word uuid). Place this file
# somewhere safe (e.g. ~/.mysecrets/o365-demo.json) and change the
# rights (e.g. chmod 0600 ~/.mysecrets/o365-demo.json). To use the
# configuration file, set your environment variable config to point
# to it; for example: export config="~/.mysecrets/o365-demo.json"
#
# Then run the app. If running the app with Docker, then pass the
# env variable to Docker and map the file location, e.g.:
#
# docker run --env config="/home/pycred/.mysecrets/o365-demo.json" \
#   --volume /home/localuser/.mysecrets/:/home/pycred/.mysecrets \
#   ...

# REMEMBER Remove these lines of text.
